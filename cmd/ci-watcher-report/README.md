# ci-watcher-report

This CLI prints a report of active issues that fall within the scope of the CI Watcher.

It will print the pagerduty incidents, their alert counts, their status, the names of pipelines that generated them, a link to the PD incident, and any notes attached to the incident.

To use it, you must supply the `PAGERDUTY_API_TOKEN` environment variable set to your own PD token.

A sample usage:

```sh
$ PAGERDUTY_API_TOKEN=(pass tokens/pagerduty/cwaldon) go run ./cmd/ci-watcher-report/
